# Doggo-Client-Rewritten
My personal client, fully rewritten using better code conventions

# ðŸ¤” What is this?
this is a personal client, made for use on my server.
This is primarily designed for my Farming Bot, a utility that automatically harvests and plants crops for farms.

# ðŸŒ± When will this project be complete?
probably never, as it is always evolving.

# âœ¨I want to make a change!
You can! Either file a PR, or create an issue.
If it is out of scope, you can always keep a fork.

# ðŸ˜­ I got banned on a server!
**this project is for anarchy/private server use.**
Using this project for other things and **getting banned is all on you.**

# ðŸ˜¡ i keep getting kicked when plowing!
tractor mode sends a ton of interaction data, and can kick you if it cannot keep up with your actions.
Either:
1. don't use plow mode.
2. change the packet rate limit.
3. wait for the project to be more stable.
