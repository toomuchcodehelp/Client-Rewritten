# Doggo-Client-Rewritten
My personal client, fully rewritten using better code conventions

## 🤔 What is this?
this is a personal client, made for use on my server.
This is primarily designed for my Farming Bot, a utility that automatically harvests and plants crops for farms.

## 🌱 When will this project be complete?
probably never, as it is always evolving.

## ✨I want to make a change!
You can! Either file a PR, or create an issue.
If it is out of scope, you can always keep a fork.

## 😭 I got banned on a server!
**this project is made for anarchy/private server use.**
Using this project for other things and **getting banned is all on you.**

## 😡 i keep getting kicked when plowing!
tractor mode sends a ton of interaction data, and can kick you if it cannot keep up with your actions.
Either:
1. don't use plow mode.
2. change the packet rate limit.
3. wait for the project to be more stable.

## 👨‍💻 what can i do with the project's code?
**You can do anything!** Just follow the AGPL and you will be fine.

## 🐞 This mod and This mod don't work together!
expect all kinds of (🐛)s to appear when using clients that do similar things.
I have solved a lot compatability issues with this, so expect most mods to be fine.
